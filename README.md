# FoodCheck AI ðŸš€

## Inspiration
Our inspiration stems from the challenges people face in navigating food choices amid varying health needs and limited awareness of nutritional information. We aim to bridge this gap by leveraging technology to empower individuals with personalized insights into their food and drug choices.

## What it does
Foodcheck AI revolutionizes health-conscious decision-making by offering tailored warnings, advice, recommendations, and food facts based on an individual's unique health profile. It analyzes food and drug products, providing real-time guidance aligned with personal health requirements.

## How we built it
We developed Foodcheck AI using cutting-edge technologies, harnessing the power of Web5 for decentralized, secure data handling. Leveraging Web5's Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Decentralized Web Nodes (DWNs), we ensured user data remained under their control. Additionally, we integrated Google Cloud Vision AI for image analysis and utilized OpenAI's ChatGPT API for comprehensive data analysis.

## Challenges we ran into
Overcoming the hurdles of data privacy and security while maintaining a user-centric approach posed significant challenges. Integrating various technologies seamlessly and ensuring real-time, accurate analysis were also key obstacles we faced.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud to have created a secure, user-focused platform that empowers individuals to make informed choices about their health. Implementing decentralized data storage, enabling comprehensive AI-driven analysis, and ensuring a seamless user experience were significant achievements for us.

## What we learned
Throughout the development process, we gained insights into the critical importance of user data control and the potential of decentralized technologies in reshaping how we handle sensitive information. We also deepened our understanding of AI-driven analysis and its applications in personalized health guidance.

## What's next for Foodcheck AI
Looking ahead, we aim to expand our platform's capabilities further. This includes refining our AI algorithms, enhancing user engagement features, and exploring integrations with additional health-related technologies. Our goal is to continuously evolve and provide even more personalized, impactful guidance to our users.




This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
